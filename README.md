Hey! I'm Khen, a Software Engineer in [BlastAsia](https://blastasia.com). I love to hack things, creating experiments and silly side projects. I also write a [blog](https://khendaniel.com/) about myself, so some questions may get longer from answers on there!

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!

Feel free to ask me whatever! Work. Life. Code. Etc!
